                <h1>Who is an Ethical Hacker?</h1>
                <p>An Ethical Hacker is a skilled professional who has excellent technical knowledge and skills and knows how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in target systems. He works with the permission of the owners of systems. An ethical Hacker must comply with the rules of the target organization or owner and the law of the land and their aim is to assess the security posture of a target organization/system.</p>
                <p>Maybe there are some people who think that hackers are criminals, you need to know that hackers are divided into several parts among which are:</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>Black Hat</b> Black is often identified with negative things. Including when classifying hackers. Hackers who fall into the black category or Black Hat are those who do hacking with how to hack a system or program illegally. </p>
                <p>The goal is also not exactly good because they do hacking to retrieve personal data of internet users such as passwords to phone numbers. They also sometimes spread the virus on another device.</p>
                <p>From the stolen personal data they can get big profits.These data, if sold, could have a very high price because many people want it.Such actions are clearly detrimental and endanger the hacked system.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>White Hat</b> Besides Black Hat hackers, there are also White Hat hackers. You could say White Hat is the opposite of Black Hat.While Black Hat uses its hacking capabilities to steal personal data and other criminal acts, White Hat does the exact opposite. They try to hack into systems or programs to find security gap.White Hat also works according to regulations and through legal methods. With this "noble" goal, White Hat is often referred to as a good hacker.</p>
                <p>Generally, White Hats are hired by a company to work closely with their development team.White Hat will look for vulnerabilities in systems created by developers.the system created can be more secure and the risk of data leakage can be minimized. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>Gray Hat</b> It turns out that between Black Hat and White Hat there is also a separate group of hackers. They are called the Gray Hat. The Gray Hats cannot be categorized as Black Hat or White Hat because they operate by combining the two methods.</p>
                <p>Gray Hat applies the methods of Black Hat hackers, but at the same time they also use methods similar to White Hat hackers. For example, when they hack a system or program, Gray Hat does it illegally like Black Hat hackers. However, unlike Black Hat hackers who leave damage to the system, Gray Hat restores the system as usual like White Hat hackers so that it seems as if nothing happened to the system.</p>
                <p>After knowing the types of hackers, you can conclude that not all hackers are criminals.There are also hackers who work legally and have special permission to hack the system, namely White Hat hackers.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there are hackers who are not exactly good, but also not criminals. They are the Gray Hat hackers. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>And there are also other hackers, namely amateur hackers. Amateur hackers are also called "Script Kidde's" They are a group of hackers who use the hacking methods of the three groups above, it's just that they rely on other people's programs or copy and paste the program and then make it a general hack. for example such as DDoS, Defense, SSL and others.</p>
                <p>Script kidde's is also a group of hackers who are just trying to dive into the world of hacking and it can be concluded that this hacker is a beginner hacker.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Hopefully this review will be useful for all of us and make learning to know about a hack.</p>
